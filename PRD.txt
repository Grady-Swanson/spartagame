Game Title: [TBD]

==================================================
Overview
==================================================
A short, replayable pixel-art game where the player helps randomly generated townsfolk with absurd problems during the 60 seconds before a darkly comedic disaster destroys the entire town. Each run resets completely. Designed for social media virality (clips/memes).

==================================================
Objective
==================================================
- Viral success on social media (target: X profile with no other posts)
- Gameplay tailored for short, funny clips
- Dark humor and absurdist tone

==================================================
Target Platform
==================================================
- PC (Windows, Linux optional)
- Distribution: itch.io, Steam
- Default windowed mode (resizable, fullscreen toggle in settings)
- File size target: <100MB for easy downloads/sharing

==================================================
Target Audience
==================================================
- Players who enjoy absurd, short indie games (e.g., Minit, McPixel, Untitled Goose Game)
- Viral clip viewers/sharers
- Speedrunners and meme enthusiasts

==================================================
Tone & Style
==================================================
- Dark humor, absurd, intentionally meaningless
- Humor from NPC problems + disaster timing
- Replay loop prioritizes chaos and surprise

==================================================
Core Loop
==================================================
1. Player spawns in procedurally generated town
2. NPCs (randomly generated) present absurd problems
3. Player interacts via dialogue choices
4. At exactly 60 seconds, a random disaster occurs
5. Everything resets: new town, new NPCs, new problems, new disaster

==================================================
Game Structure
==================================================
- Runs last exactly 60 seconds
- Timer always visible at top of screen (MM:SS format, countdown)
- No progress carries between runs
- No relationship tracking or payoff
- Restart flow: instant reset to new run (no menus unless player quits)

==================================================
NPC System
==================================================
- NPCs randomly generated each run
- Components:
  - Randomized names (simple, absurd, or normal)
  - Pixel art sprites (color variations, randomized outfits)
  - Assigned one problem from curated problem list
- Population per run: 8–12 NPCs (scattered in town)

==================================================
Disasters
==================================================
At exactly 0 seconds, one disaster is chosen randomly:
1. A massive cat crushes the city
2. A massive tomato falls on the city
3. A shark emerges from the water and eats the city
4. The city suddenly explodes

Each disaster has:
- Unique pixel animation (oversized, fast, absurd)
- Accompanying sound effect (crash, squish, roar, boom)

==================================================
Art Direction
==================================================
- Pixel art (retro-inspired but clean)
- Tile size: 32x32
- Resolution target: 640x360 (scales cleanly x2/x3)
- Palette: 32–64 colors (bright, meme-friendly)
- NPCs: 4-frame walk cycle, 1 idle frame, 2 talk frames
- Disasters: 3–5 frame animations

==================================================
Town Layout
==================================================
- Procedurally generated each run
- Components:
  - 10–15 buildings (non-interactive, decorative)
  - Randomized dirt paths/roads
  - NPCs scattered in walkable areas
- Grid-based placement for simplicity
- Interaction limited to NPCs

==================================================
Gameplay Features
==================================================
- Interact: Space or Enter
- Timer displayed top center
- Dialogue presented in text box (2–3 choices per problem)
- Instant reset after disaster

==================================================
Technical Requirements
==================================================
- Language: C++
- Single-player only
- Lightweight runtime (<100MB build)
- Pixel-perfect camera scaling

==================================================
UI/UX
==================================================
- Timer at top of screen
- Minimal HUD (timer only)
- Interaction indicator: small “!” icon above NPCs
- Dialogue box bottom of screen, pixel font
- Instant restart button (R key)

==================================================
Audio
==================================================
- Retro-style sound effects (8-bit inspired)
- Short looping background track (upbeat, absurd)
- Each disaster has unique sound effect:
  - Cat: deep meow + crash
  - Tomato: splat
  - Shark: chomp
  - Explosion: boom + rumble

==================================================
Marketing & Virality
==================================================
- Gameplay optimized for funny 30–60 second clips
- Disasters designed to look absurd in GIF format
- NPC problems built for meme screenshots
- Distribution strategy:
  - Release free/cheap on itch.io
  - Push to X/TikTok via short gameplay clips
  - Encourage “one-more-run” replay culture

==================================================
Success Metrics
==================================================
- Number of clips/memes shared on social platforms
- Viral reach (likes, retweets, TikTok stitches)
- Downloads/installs (low price/free helps viral adoption)

==================================================
Next Steps
==================================================
1. Expand NPC problem pool (target: 50 problems)
2. Define sprite sheet assets (NPCs, disasters, tiles)
3. Implement town generator (grid-based, randomized)
4. Code disaster system (timer trigger, random selection)
5. Playtest for pacing + humor flow
6. Package small demo for viral testing
